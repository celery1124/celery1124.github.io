## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering Department of Texas A&M University working with Dr. [Paul V. Gratz](https://cesg.tamu.edu/faculty/paul-gratz/) and [Dr. Narasimha Reddy](https://cesg.tamu.edu/faculty/narasimha-reddy/).

My research interest is SW/HW co-design and implementation of computer system with field programmable gate array (FPGA) for hybrid memory/storage system.  I also worked on serveral projects on top of Samsung new released [KV-SSDs](https://github.com/OpenMPDK/KVSSD).

My previous work centers on design and implementation of high-speed data acquisition and broadband signal processing systems. Please see more details on the [project](https://sites.google.com/view/mian-qin/projects?authuser=0) page of my website.
